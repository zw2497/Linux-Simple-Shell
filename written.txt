1. Exercise 1.6
   a,c,e,f,g,h

2. Exercise 1.14
   when a hardware is powerful and expensive, it can use
   this OS to share the compute resources with others in
   order to lower its cost.

3. Exercise 1.19
   (1) Interrupt signaled the occurrence of an event. Both
   hardware and software need to trigger interrupts to
   inform CPU to immediately transfer execution to another.
   Many I/O devices need interrupt to perform action.

   (2) A trap is a software-generated interrupt, but interrupt
   can be caused by a hardware.

   (3) Yes, a trap can caused by a specific request from
   a user program that an operating-system service be performed.

4. Exercise 1.27
   (1) Limited resources. The resources such as memory capacity
   and processing speed are more limited than those of PCs.

   (2) power consumption.  The os need to carefully manage all
   the programs not to produce massive power consumption.

5. Exercise 2.16
   Many os treat devices as files.
   Advantages:
   (1) For developers, it is easy to learn and convenient
   to use if accessing file and device is combined in a same way.
   (2) For hardware device company, they can follow uniformed API
   which is easy for costumer to learn.

   Disadvantages:
   Many devices may have more functions which the file API can
   not cover.

6. Exercise 2.21
   Main advantage:
   (1) it makes extending the operating system easier. New services
   are added without modification of the kernel.
   (2) The microkernel is a smaller kernel. It means when the kernel
   does have to be modified, the changes tend to be fewer.
   (3) The microkernel also provides more security and reliability,
   since most services are running as user—rather than kernel—processes.


   Communication is provided through message passing.

   Disadvantage:
   The performance of microkernels can suffer due to increased
   system-function overhead.
